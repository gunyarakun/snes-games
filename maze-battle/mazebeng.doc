	   First,I'm Japanese and can't write or read English well,so
	this writing can't make you understand I wanna tell.

	   This is a very exciting game (maybe) ! It is for SNES and
	SHVC(Super Famicom),and it needs two people who play game.

	   1 Player (in screen,you see whose window on your left)
	start at the most left and down position in maze.2 Player
	(whose window is another window) start at the mose right and
	up position in maze.1P go toward 2P's start point,and 2P go
	toward 1P's.Arriving at each other's start point,Players go
	back to one's start point.

	   Faster player of the two wins the game !
